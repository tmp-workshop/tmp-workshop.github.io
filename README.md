### Login to the server
You should now be able to login to the workshop server at: [https://jhub.eaton-lab.org](https://jhub.eaton-lab.org). 

### About the server
You are now logged into a `jupyterhub` instance running on the Eaton-lab server at Columbia University. While here, you will be contained within a Docker container, which limits the parts of the system that you have access to. But, you do have full read/write access to this part of the filesystem, including the ability to install software into your own local conda distribution. In addition, most software you would need is already installed for you.
